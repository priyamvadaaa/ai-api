the product is very nice, but the extra expenditure is to be kept in mind like frame for fitting the AC, the grill cutting core cutting for passing the wires and duct. etc. The installation fees is 1500 and the extra parts totalling the cost to above 5.2k which I feel is high... Apart from 5.2k installation, the AC is very nice cooling is nice. Please lower the installation & fitment cost.
Bought it for my Kerala home and thought Daikin is a know brand and I would like it. But, I was wrong. From day 1, the cooling of the AC is abominable. It starts slowly and reaches at around 90-97% compressor capacity and after a little time starts reducing its capacity and stays at 45-55% then after. Reported the issue to the company and they sent technician from some Giant Air System and they say that ambient temperature is high and that’s why it’s like that. I wonder that if 34 degrees ambient temperature is high for this AC, what would happen to people who buy it for Delhi or places like that? It’s been more than 25 days since I’ve registered the complaint and have called Giant Air Systems multiple times but till date they have not attended it.My suggestion would is people, don’t buy this brand. Their service is poor and you will regret your decision like I am right now.
